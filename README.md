#  In this project I implement an ArrayStack ADT and use the stack for implementing a method for evaluation of arithmetic expressions in Java
# @EvaluateExpressions Method: Accept an input argument of String type representing an arithmetic expression and return the result of the expression evaluation. The expression includes arithmetic and relational binary operators {+, -, *, /, >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=} and integer values as operands. The result of the expression will be an integer or a boolean value.
